\usage{
betweenness.estimate(
  graph,
  vids = V(graph),
  directed = TRUE,
  cutoff,
  weights = NULL,
  nobigint = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The graph to analyze.}

\item{vids}{The vertices for which the vertex betweenness estimation will be
calculated.}

\item{directed}{Logical, whether directed paths should be considered while
determining the shortest paths.}

\item{cutoff}{The maximum path length to consider when calculating the
betweenness. If zero or negative then there is no such limit.}

\item{weights}{Optional positive weight vector for calculating weighted
betweenness. If the graph has a \code{weight} edge attribute, then this is
used by default. Weights are used to calculate weighted shortest paths,
so they are interpreted as distances.}

\item{nobigint}{Logical scalar, whether to use big integers during the
calculation. Deprecated since igraph 1.3 and will be removed in igraph 1.4.}

\code{betweenness.estimate()} was renamed to \code{estimate_betweenness()} to create a more
