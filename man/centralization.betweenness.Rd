\title{Centralize a graph according to the betweenness of vertices}
\usage{
centralization.betweenness(
  graph,
  directed = TRUE,
  nobigint = TRUE,
  normalized = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The input graph.}

\item{directed}{logical scalar, whether to use directed shortest paths for
calculating betweenness.}

\item{nobigint}{Logical scalar, whether to use big integers for the
betweenness calculation. This argument is deprecated in igraph 1.3 and
will be removed in igraph 1.4.}

\item{normalized}{Logical scalar. Whether to normalize the graph level
centrality score by dividing by the theoretical maximum.}
